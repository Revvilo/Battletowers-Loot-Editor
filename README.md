# Battletowers Loot Editor
Provides a GUI for use in editing the configuration file from the Minecraft mod "Battletowers"  
Primarily created to ease the editing of the abhorrent loot format used in the mod. These days I think Battletowers might be going out of date due to people waking up to the degree of code rot it has.
